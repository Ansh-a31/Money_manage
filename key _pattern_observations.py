### **ðŸ”¥ Golden Rules**  
1. **Always check volatility (GK vol)**:  
   - High (>0.0020) = Be careful, big moves possible.  
   - Low (<0.0010) = Small, predictable moves.  
2. **Weekend = Danger Zone**:  
   - Avoid holding big positions over Sunday.  
3. **Wednesday = Best Day to Buy**  
4. **Sunday = Best Day to Short**  

This is a **simple, rule-based strategy** based on past trends. Always use stop-losses and adjust for news/events! ðŸš€
